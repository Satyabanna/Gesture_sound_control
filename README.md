Gesture-Based Sound Control System

Implemented a gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to control the system volume based on hand movements detected via webcam.

~Utilized OpenCV for real-time video capture and image processing.
~Leveraged MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection and tracking.
~Integrated PyCaw library to manipulate system audio volume.
~Calculated distances between hand landmarks to dynamically adjust the volume.
~Enhanced user experience by providing a hands-free method to control audio levels.

Skills: Python, Computer Vision, Real-Time Processing, Image Processing, Audio Control, OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyCaw
